* We use the parameter `swarm.transactions.object-store-path` relativelly as it has trouble with absolute path.
  We go from location like

  ```
  ./tmp/wildfly-self-contained1289751191330356060.d/data/ShadowNoFileLockStore
  ```

  Then we expect that OpenShift mounts the persistent claim at `/data`

* I discussed what is expected base image for openshift and swarm and Lada Thon points me to 

```
FROM redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift
```

but it should work in the same way as e.g. `fabric8/java-centos-openjdk8-jre`
